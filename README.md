## Semi-supervised semantic segmentation with cross pseudo supervision

Introduction: If you happen to use two sets of parameters when you do contrastive pretraining. Can also be used when we only have a small proportion of
data labeled.

## Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical imaging segmentation with self-ensembling

Introduction: A way to make model more generalized for different scenarios. But I think this can already be achieved with
