## [A comparison of linear genetic programming and neural networks in medical data mining](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=910462)
**Abstract:**  
We introduce a new form of linear genetic programming (GP). Two methods of acceleration of our GP approach are discussed: 1) an efficient algorithm that eliminates intron code and 2) a demetic approach to virtually parallelize the system on a single processor. Acceleration of runtime is especially important when operating with complex data sets, because they are occurring in real-world applications. We compare GP performance on medical classification problems from a benchmark database with results obtained by neural networks. Our results show that GP performs comparably in classification and generalization.

## [Evolving computer programs without subtree crossover](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/661552)
**Abstract:**  
An evolutionary programming procedure is used for optimizing computer programs in the form of symbolic expressions. Six tree mutation operators are proposed. Recombination operators such as crossover are not included. The viability and efficiency of the method is extensively investigated on a set of well-studied problems. The evidence indicates that the technique is not only viable but is indeed capable of evolving good computer programs. The results compare well with other evolutionary methods that rely on crossover to solve the same problems.

## [Distilling Free-Form Natural Laws from Experimental Data](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/81)
**Abstract:**  
For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems.
