**Abstract:**  
We introduce a new form of linear genetic programming (GP). Two methods of acceleration of our GP approach are discussed: 1) an efficient algorithm that eliminates intron code and 2) a demetic approach to virtually parallelize the system on a single processor. Acceleration of runtime is especially important when operating with complex data sets, because they are occurring in real-world applications. We compare GP performance on medical classification problems from a benchmark database with results obtained by neural networks. Our results show that GP performs comparably in classification and generalization.
