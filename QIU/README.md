## [A comparison of linear genetic programming and neural networks in medical data mining](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=910462)
**Abstract:**  
We introduce a new form of linear genetic programming (GP). Two methods of acceleration of our GP approach are discussed: 1) an efficient algorithm that eliminates intron code and 2) a demetic approach to virtually parallelize the system on a single processor. Acceleration of runtime is especially important when operating with complex data sets, because they are occurring in real-world applications. We compare GP performance on medical classification problems from a benchmark database with results obtained by neural networks. Our results show that GP performs comparably in classification and generalization.

## [Evolving computer programs without subtree crossover](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/661552)
**Abstract:**  
An evolutionary programming procedure is used for optimizing computer programs in the form of symbolic expressions. Six tree mutation operators are proposed. Recombination operators such as crossover are not included. The viability and efficiency of the method is extensively investigated on a set of well-studied problems. The evidence indicates that the technique is not only viable but is indeed capable of evolving good computer programs. The results compare well with other evolutionary methods that rely on crossover to solve the same problems.
